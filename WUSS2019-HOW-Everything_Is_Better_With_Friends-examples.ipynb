    "4. One benefit of this process is being able to extract and modify the SAS code. For example, if a convenience method doesn't offer an option like a class statement for PROC MEANS, we can manually add it to the code generated by the `teach_me_SAS` method and then execute the modified SAS code using either the `submit` method (as in Example 9 above) or the `%%SAS` Jupyter magic (as in Extra Credit Example 2 below)."
