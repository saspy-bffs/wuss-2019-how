# Everything is better with friends: Executing SAS code in Python scripts with SASPy

### Materials from a Hands-on Workshop at [Western Users of SAS Software](https://www.wuss.org/) in Seattle, Washington, on September 5, 2019.

Materials provided:

- Workshop [paper](WUSS2019-HOW-Everything_Is_Better_With_Friends-paper.pdf) and [slides](WUSS2019-HOW-Everything_Is_Better_With_Friends-slides.pdf)

- Workshop examples in both [Jupyter Notebook](WUSS2019-HOW-Everything_Is_Better_With_Friends-examples.ipynb) and [Python script](WUSS2019-HOW-Everything_Is_Better_With_Friends-examples.py) format

- [Instructions](WUSS2019-HOW-Everything_Is_Better_With_Friends-handout.pdf) for replicating Workshop examples/demos

All development was done under Windows 10 with Python 3.7 and SAS 9.4 locally installed. Any deviation from this setup might require modifications to example code.

## Prerequisites

All examples assume a reasonably current version of Python 3 is installed, along with the modules specified in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

The Jupyter Notebook example file assumes SAS University Edition ([https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition/download-software.html](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition/download-software.html)) is being used.

The Python script example file requires access to installations of Java SE ([https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/)) and SAS 9.4 ([https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/sas9.html](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/sas9.html)), and the instructions in [sascfg_personal-example.py](sascfg_personal-example.py) should be used to create a file called `sascfg_personal.py` in the project directory.
